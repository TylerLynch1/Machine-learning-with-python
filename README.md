# Machine Learning With Python
This is a basic machine learning repository. It contains basic supervised learning algorithms that can be used as a point of reference for beginners to ML. Data preprocessing is not shown. All code is in Python.
<br><br>This repo contains one folder, [Code](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/tree/ea2a6dada31db11a9f6cd5dc74961d65fae5225a/Code) with nine files.
<br>They are:
- [decision_tree.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/decision_tree.py)
- [decision_tree_kfold.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/decision_tree_kfold.py)
- [knn.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/knn.py)
- [knn_kfold.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/knn_kfold.py)
- [linear_regression.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/linear_regression.py)
- [logistic_regression.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/logistic_regression.py)
- [logistic_regression_kfold.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/logistic_regression_kfold.py)
- [random_forest.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/random_forest.py)
- [random_forest_kfold.py](https://github.com/TylerLynch1/Machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/Code/random_forest_kfold.py)
